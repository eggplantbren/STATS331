STATS 331
=========

This is a set of lecture notes for the undergraduate course STATS 331, at
The University of Auckland. The course has few prerequisites, so assumes fairly
minimal background in mathematics and probability. The first ten chapters are
relatively complete but could use more examples. The latter chapter chapters
are rough drafts and are works in progress.

If you don't want the Latex source and just want to read the notes, you can go

There are also new slides from 2025 in the NewSlides folder (work in progress).
